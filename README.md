<h1>Fuzzy Temperature Category Classifier</h1>

This program classifies temperatures into four categories: Freezing, Cool, Warm, and Hot using fuzzy logic and linear equations. It calculates fuzzy membership values for each category based on the input temperature and displays the classification along with a graphical representation of the membership values.
